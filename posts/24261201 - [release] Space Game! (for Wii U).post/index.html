<p>On Feb 9 2016 I released a little homebrew app for the Wii U called Space Game! <a href="https://youtu.be/KMuicPmOIHw">Here's a video</a> of me playing it.</p>
<p>You can play the game on the latest 5.5.0/5.5.1 Wii U firmwares by going to <a href="http://space.vgmoose.com/">space.vgmoose.com</a>. I've written a couple of posts about it on <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-space-game.414342/">gbatemp</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/45fc0l/a_homebrew_game_i_made_for_wii_u/">reddit</a>. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/vgmoose/space">my github</a>.</p>

<p>Please enjoy! I hope to one day make my splash as a real developer on a Nintendo console, but until then, this homebrew stuff is the only card I can play.</p>
