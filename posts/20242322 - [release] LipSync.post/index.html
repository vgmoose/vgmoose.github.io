<p>LipSync is GOOD CLEAN FAMILY FUN.</p>
<p>It's a port of a Mario Party Advance Gaddget that let you pretend you had the mouth of a Nintendo character. The four characters are Mario, Peach, Boo, and Goomba. They all come in separate apps, which can be downloaded together <a href="http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=22411&amp;d=1213512067">&gt;&gt;here</a>. Also, thanks to PabloPPP, there is a convenient all-in-one launcher, which can be found <a href="http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=22510&amp;d=1213637554">&gt;&gt;here</a>. The all-in-one won't work with the Boo Application due to a .plist overlap, but you can modify this easily if you know what you're doing.</p>
