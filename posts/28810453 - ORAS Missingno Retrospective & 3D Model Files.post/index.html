<p>In 2016, I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7eVWhewLnEY">a video</a> where I modded a Missingno model and short event into Omega Ruby. This was actually <em>itself</em> a much-later sequel to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvVCTKdhOZk">2007 video</a> where I did something similar in the original Ruby version!</p>
<p>This is both a post to reflect on that, but also to upload those models that I made back then. They can be downloaded here: <a href="./missingno_model_files.zip">missingno_model_files.zip</a>.</p>
<p>From what I remember, for 3DS modding, each face in the OBJ file cannot have more than 3 vertices (triangular faces only). Maybe it's chnaged since then, but that was a constraint that I remember having to manually edit and fix. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">OBJ text file format</a> is also not too bad to work with directly in a text editor.</p>

<p>I love all the extended lore around Missingno, and although I had always wanted it to be officially acknowledged by Nintendo in later games, living on in fan creations is pretty great too!</p>
<p>Actually, somehow the ORAS video got enough views that it did a circuit on gaming sites, and I was <a href="https://kotaku.com/someone-hacked-missingno-into-a-modern-pokemon-game-1788292004">interviewed on the topic of Missingno by Kotaku</a>. I think the "why" of how a decades old easter egg and glitch attracts fan attention is super interesting.</p>
<p>Here's the 2016 video where this model was used:</p>

<p>And here's the older 2007 video with the Missingno Event as well, just for completeness:</p>
<p>Am I someone that every 8 or so years makes a Missingno video? Maybe!</p>
