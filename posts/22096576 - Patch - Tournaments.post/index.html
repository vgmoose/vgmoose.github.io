<p>Based on everybody's feedback from the last tournament that we ran, I've made the following adjustments:</p>
<p>Things you as the user will notice:</p>
<ol>
<li>The page can be safely refreshed after reporting a victory, you won't be advanced two rounds now.</li>
<li>The second place "Report Victory" button will not stay after the tournament ends</li>
<li>I added a refresh link in the upper right of tournaments just to reduce future refresh issues</li>
</ol>
<p>Behind the scene things that you won't notice:</p>
<ol>
<li>The page can be refreshed after checking in, users won't be re-assigned tournament IDs</li>
<li>Setting a tournament to check-in mode does not lock the brackets</li>
<li>Tournaments will now be seeded by points when they are started</li>
<li>New tournaments will not be created in running mode</li>
<li>Setup Tourney button looks nicer</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all folks! </p>
