The special state where these checks are skipped can be stored, which will allow visiting other areas without taking poison damage or fainting while walking.

This is done by changing this line in the decompilation (to HIGH(\1 * 2), LOW(\1 * 2) or HIGH(\1 * 4), LOW(\1) * 4).
This creates a slightly better experience if you use 2x or 4x speed up / fast forwarding in an emulator, so that the sound isn't just a cacophony of sped up noises. It's not perfect though!

You can enter any website in the box and it will go to it. You can also search the mobile internet (SSR mode). Hitting Home returns you to the URL box, and hitting Sleep/Wake turns it off... which is pointless...
Future things for this, so that it may actually be practical, are drag and drop interface, and the ability for other websites to recognize it as an iPod, allowing it to access the iPod version.

Now, I know quite a bit of HTML, but the reason that I chose to use WordPress to show my work is because it's easy to use and update.
Well, that's all I have to say for now.

It's a port of a Mario Party Advance Gaddget that let you pretend you had the mouth of a Nintendo character. The four characters are Mario, Peach, Boo, and Goomba. They all come in separate apps, which can be downloaded together &gt;&gt;here. Also, thanks to PabloPPP, there is a convenient all-in-one launcher, which can be found &gt;&gt;here. The all-in-one won't work with the Boo Application due to a .plist overlap, but you can modify this easily if you know wh...</div><br>2007: <a href="blog/im-back-2091900798">I'm Back!</a> <div class='minidescription'>And just when you thought you were safe! Well, after about 6 months the site is back up. This computer (our laptop) is getting really annoying! It has begun to reset itself, (as in all data go buh-bye), on a daily basis! It's not a trojan, (because one time it did it before we even got on the internet), but it just keeps deleting the required files, and we have to reset the whole thing, (which unfortunately takes 3 hours). I've found my memory stick though, so now I hardly do anything without it...</div><br>2006: <a href="blog/mamamia-3904971533">Mamamia!!!</a> <div class='minidescription'>General
Sorry I haven't been around to update, but that "minor problem" mentioned earlier, turned out to be a HUGE problem. See the Computer Programing section for more. Also, the Address Book and Friend Codes are (still) on their way! Also, I've been living it up at Camp Hyrule this week. It was awesome! We were in Cabin 7, and came in 3rd place! That's prizeworthy! If you want to PM me on NSider, my sn is AGS1. Hopefully there won't be another error, and this blog can liiiiive!

The Talking site... IT'S COMING!!! Now that I have a microphone, I'm going to have the site TALK TO YOU!!!! I'm 99% Sure it will get on your nerves! Sorry about Skipping an update, it's just that the Pokemon tournament was Crazy! There was so much to do, with so lot of lines! The line for Celebi and the top twenty was out the mall! (well not really). But, it got so long, that at 2:00 they closed it because the line was 3 hours long, and the tournament was only until 5:00!

I've added some new stuff to the Side Bar, including a chat box, the Mario Kart DS Theme, and Two new sections. Also, I got my first comment in record timing, and answered it. This site hardly ever gives me any trouble, so if you are trying to make a blog, try BlogDrive! (see side bar)

The site is now up and running! From now on, you will see a bunch of daily Blog Updates (duh!) broken down into 3 Sections. If you do not understand Computer Programming, then I suggest you don't read that section. I'll occasionally have a Download section too, when I decide to give you all some good stuff! Also, check out the Moose Wiki, that features a ton of information on Video Games, all 100% editable. That's all for Now!

So what is the next Kirby Game? Good question! But what exactly is Kirby Potential? Well, most of the time, Kirby games have the classic side to side scrolling, suck up powers, and King Dedede theme. A certain few may be Mini-Games, and another handful could be fighting or racing games, but, the most recent creation of HAL, Kirby Canvas Curse, was pretty fun, but it only used the to...</div>
