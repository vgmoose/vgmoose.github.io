        <p>That actually took about a billion more years than I thought that it would've. I'm not even kidding. Maybe it's just the ridiculous amount of detail I went into. I don't even think any one needs a VBA tutorial, so I honestly don't know what all that was about. I'm thinking Advance Map, or Advance Text will be next, as they are excellent tools for beginners. Also, I'm terrified of attempting to explain scripting, so I shall put that off as long as I have to.</p>
<p>And yes, as usual the Interactive Adventure is being worked on. I'm still trying to decide if I want it to keep going or if I just want to finish it. I mean, I think it'd be cool if I could keep adding chapters to it and it would appear to go on forever, maybe even branch out in a choose-your-own-adventure style thing. Then again, that is so much infinitely more work, it isn't even funny. So yeah, I'll stick to ending it now, then if I feel completely motivated later I'll extend the story. I think it's a good ending though, ya'll should be happy(?).</p>
<p>EDIT: Added a scrollbar to allow all of the comments to show on the Comments page. Not like they're all just spam anyway, but whatever.</p>
