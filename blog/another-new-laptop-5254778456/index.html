        <p>I find myself with another new laptop, this time only 1.5 years later. It turns out I bought <a href="https://vgmoose.com/blog/yes-im-still-here-5734290197/">previous one</a> at basically the worst possible time. This is now "officially" my fourth Macbook in 12 years, further solidfying my ties to the Apple ecosystem. Although, the <a href="https://asahilinux.org">Asahi Linux</a> project looks very promising for running linux here in the future!</p>
<p>The 2020 MBP I got towards "the start" of the pandemic (which is weird to say, considering it was May 2020 which felt deep-pandemic at the time). I got it at a time where the 2017 MBP keyboard failed me and I needed a functional one for work. Little did I know, a short 3 months later, Apple would release practically the same form factor 2020 MBP but with an M1 chip rather than an Intel one!</p>
<p>It's sad because this <em>again</em> means that not only did the 2017 MBP not last very long, but neither did the 2020... Although to be fair, it's still usable in the future since it has a trustworthy keyboard. I really don't want to get in a position where I'm buying Macs every year, but as I do more macOS and iOS developing I will <em>at least</em> need to be on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>I'm fortunate to be in a position that my early-upgrade in mid-2020 isn't going to set me back too much, and that I will get mileage out of the new architecture. It does seem like a pretty deliberate move on Apple's part however to announce a fixed and working keyboard in the Intel line first... then wait 3 months and announce the same form factor with the M1 chips. If they announced them at the same time, of course they wouldn't have sold as many Intels.</p>
<p>Then again, then I'd just be upset about the M1 Pro/new form factor coming the next year. It's a cycle. But also... it's totally in Apple's controls. They obviously knew they were going to have the new 14-inch design, it was being leaked forever, but still made M1 Macs with the 13-inch design. I don't know, it's hard to watch these things come out on a yearly basis like the phones, knowing that certain moves are definitely decided in advanced.</p>

<p>The actual laptop is very nice. It's a bit heavier, but a lot cooler to the touch. I use my computer on my actual lap/body very frequently so this is a pretty important quality. Getting burned because I have too many apps open made comfortably using the old laptop pretty difficult.</p>
<p>The real important bit though is the M1 Pro processor. I got the "base model" of the 14-inch to make it easier to re-gift and part ways with down the road. I don't <em>expect</em> to buy another one soon, but with the crazy performance jump from Intel -&gt; M1 -&gt; M1 Pro within not even two years, I'm just hedging my bets.</p>
<p>Even something like 512GB storage is not the end of the world, as I have other fast network storage available now. What solidified my decision further was realizing that <strong>half</strong> of my 1TB storage on the 2020 model was filled with a <strong>backup</strong> of my 2017 model! So obviously I haven't been as starved for storage as I have been in the past.</p>
<p>MagSafe is also a very nice return! HDMI and SD card I find less important. They are nice to have, but for me, I'd rather have a USB-A or Ethernet port. The <a href="https://frame.work/">Framework laptop</a> solves this problem in an elegant way. But Apple's new architecture is pretty hard to compete with, especially for laptops. Framework does seem to be <a href="https://frame.work/blog/the-upgradeable-mainboard">heading that way</a>!</p>
<p>The last thing worth mentioning is this is the first Macbook in a while to not contain glued down batteries, and have other more-modular parts. It's still very far away from what Framework has done, however.</p>
<p>Welp, here's to hopefully not continuing to get a new Mac in the near to mid future! Probably!</p>
<p>PS. Wait! I forgot about the notch! I hate the notch!... in theory. But, I have it hidden on my MBP (via a black bar on the wallpaper) and that area of the screen also isn't very active in macOS.</p>
