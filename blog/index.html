There are some (really good!) articles on the Internet about how to communicate with a traditional UIView or UIViewController from a parent SwiftUI view. Like this one, or this one.
I have the impression though that they're coming at the problem from a UIKit perspective though, which makes sense given that a traditional UIView is being used.

Usage
Download and resize these to 42mm x 37mm (or 4.2cm x 3.7cm) and print on sticker paper.
The Picross label is made using edited assets from Pokémon Picross Adventure, which itself is using the 3DS version's logo.

This creates a slightly better experience if you use 2x or 4x speed up / fast forwarding in an emulator, so that the sound isn't just a cacophony of sped up noises. It's not perfect though!
