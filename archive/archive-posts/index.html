I chose to get this computer, as I had been playing with iOS (then called iPhone OS) as well as Hackintoshes. I had grown fond of OS X (then Mac OS X).
Despite this, however, I had my heart set on the HP Pavilion tx2000, as the idea of turning the screen around to make it into a "tablet" interested me. During the deciding process, though, I came across this video de...</div>

OctopusSlap.com was made on February 19th 2015, and it was created using stills from this YouTube video by Rhett and Link.

Introduction
I happened to catch the Good Mythical Morning episode early, about a half hour after it went up. During the video, Rhett and Link parody the existing EelSlap.com, with an octopus instead. Before being slapped, Rhett excla...</div>

I wanted to frontlight my gbc, as modern screens have spoiled me to the point where the original gameboy color screen appears almost unreadable. There are a lot of cool mods on /r/gameboy, so after doing some research I finally bought an SP and started on the mod. I was pretty nervous after looking at all the tutorials, but I'm surprised (and happy) to say that it worked out!

While it isn't a practical use for production, my manager suggested I could emulate this faster behavior by using a ramdisk, as 2/3 of my machines don't have flash storage. A RAM disk, (which, from this point on, I shall continue going back and forth between "RAM disk" and "ramdisk" spellings) allows a piece of memory to be sectioned off and mounted like a disk would.

To recap, snapshots physically store only the differences between a filesystem at a given time and the present.

That, of course, is really cool, but let's say you want to take a TON of snapshots (...</div>

THE DAY WAS UPON US. Let me clear up a few misconceptions first. The first of which being, driving is a rather difficult process. The entire route consists of this exactly: turn right, left, right, right, left, straight for a relatively long time, left, and then a right turn into the Red Hat Westford office.

Here is the schedule for the two days:

The notable things that I've taken away from the schedule are the 10 minute "Intro and Icebreaker" at 9:35, which I'm hoping will not be horribly embarrassing in any way shape or form. An hour long talk about "Ethics and Legal" does not sound like it would be terribly interesting either.

It's a nice little application that may come in handy every once in a while. Like, if some ugly kid wants to go on safari, simply launch UnderScore, and he can't use it. Ho...</div>

Sorry I haven't been around to update, but that "minor problem" mentioned earlier, turned out to be a HUGE problem. See the Computer Programing section for more. Also, the Address Book and Friend Codes are (still) on their way! Also, I've been living it up at Camp Hyrule this week. It was awesome! We were in Cabin 7, and came in 3rd place! That's prizeworthy!

The site is now up and running! From now on, you will see a bunch of daily Blog Updates (duh!) broken down into 3 Sections. If you do not understand Computer Programming, then I suggest you don't read that section. I'll occasionally have a Download section too, when I decide to give you all some good stuff! Also, check out the Moose Wiki, that features a ton of information on Video Games, all 100% editable. That's all for Now!
